Feature: View list of articles
  In order to manage articles
  As an administrator
  I need to be able to view all the articles

  Background:
    Given init doctrine phpcr repository
    And there are users:
      | email             | role       | password |
      | admin@example.com | ROLE_ADMIN | password |
    And there are root taxons:
      | code     | name     |
      | articles | Articles |
    And there are taxons:
      | code    | name       | parent   |
      | news    | Actualit√©s | articles |
      | reviews | Critiques  | articles |
    And there are articles:
      | taxon               | title                        | author            |
      | articles/actualites | King of New York : Power Up! | admin@example.com |
      | articles/critiques  | Critique de Vroom Vroom      | admin@example.com |
    And I am logged in as user "admin@example.com" with password "password"

  Scenario: View list of articles
    When I am on "/admin/articles/"
    Then I should see "Critique de Vroom Vroom"
    And I should see "King of New York : Power Up!"
