# workers.properties -
#
# This file is a simplified version of the workers.properties supplied
# with the upstream sources. The jni inprocess worker (not build in the
# debian package) section and the ajp12 (deprecated) section are removed.
#
# As a general note, the characters $( and ) are used internally to define
# macros. Do not use them in your own configuration!!!
#
# Whenever you see a set of lines such as:
# x=value
# y=$(x)\something
#
# the final value for y will be value\something
#
# Normaly all you will need to do is un-comment and modify the first three
# properties, i.e. workers.tomcat_home, workers.java_home and ps.
# Most of the configuration is derived from these.
#
#
# workers.tomcat_home should point to the location where you
# installed tomcat. This is where you have your conf, webapps and lib
# directories.
#
workers.tomcat_home=tomcat6

#
# workers.java_home should point to your Java installation. Normally
# you should have a bin and lib directories beneath it.
#
workers.java_home=/usr/lib/jvm/default-java

#
# You should configure your environment slash... ps=\ on NT and / on UNIX
# and maybe something different elsewhere.
#
ps=/
